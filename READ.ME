Design and of a mini regular expression engine that supports the following grammar:
- literals: for example, the pattern "cat" on the string "the cat sat on the mat" results in ["cat"]
- alternation, via the "|" (pipe) symbol: for example, the pattern "cat|dog" on the string "the cat sat on the dog" results in ["cat", "dog"]
